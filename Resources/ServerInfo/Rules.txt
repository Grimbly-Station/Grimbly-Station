[color=#ff0000]YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE TO PLAY ON GRIMBLY STATION SERVERS. ANY USERS SUSPECTED OF BEING UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE WILL BE BANNED UNTIL THEY ARE OF AGE.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]DISCONNECTING FROM OR IGNORING/EVADING ADMIN-HELPS WILL RESULT IN AN APPEAL ONLY BAN.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]THE USAGE OF ANY THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS/SCRIPTS/CLIENT MODIFICATIONS TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE, AVOID INTENDED GAME/SERVER MECHANICS, OR TO HARM SERVER INFRASTRUCTURE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED. ANY AND ALL INSTANCES OF THIS WILL BE MET WITH AN APPEAL-ONLY BAN.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]If you have any questions about these rules, please use the admin help menu by hitting F1 in-game or clicking the "AHelp" button in the lobby

[color=#ffff00]Grimbly Station is a Medium Roleplay server. Try to immerse yourself into your character. This includes doing your job, interacting with your fellow crewmates, and using roleplay as the primary vessel to play the game. MRP places less emphasis on “winning” and more on just telling a story.[/color]

[color=#ffff00]If you have any questions about these rules, please use the admin help (ahelp) menu by hitting F1 in-game or clicking the “Ahelp” button in the lobby.[/color]

Space Station 14 is not like most games. Many rules are designed to require roleplay, and not all rules are intuitive. Please take the time to read and understand the rules before you play so that you aren't surprised. Our community rules specifically are zero-tolerance rules, meaning that a violation will result in an appeal-only ban. Game admins will treat you as if you have read the rules, even if you have not.

[color=#a4885c]0.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large.[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Administrators will be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.
    - All of these rules apply as they are intended. Every example of a rule break cannot be defined as written, therefore, enforcement of the rules is subject to staff interpretation of the rule's intention.
    - Any extended discussion regarding interpretation of the rules should be avoided in the AHelp menu and can be instead pursued within the Grimbly Station Discord in the #help channel.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Erotic Roleplay (ERP), erotic content, or 18+ sexual content is [/color][color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance[/color]. [color=#fcff00]This mainly includes comments not explicitly sexual in nature that contain words, phrases, or ideations that are deemed inappropriate.[/color] [color=#ff0000]If roleplay reaches a point where it has become sexual and/or uncomfortable, immediately stop and contact an administrator.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Follow the server expectations[/color]

    [color=#00c5ff]2A. Gameplay Expectations[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Do not cheat.
    - Do not abuse glitches and exploits. [/color][color=#ff0000]We have zero tolerance for abusing exploits/bugs. If you’re not sure, ask an admin.[/color][color=#ffffff] Otherwise, please use the #bug-reports channel on the Discord to report the bug.
    - If you are banned from a role or department, you may not play that role. This includes seeking or accepting promotions into roles you are banned from.
    - Do not make yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for the crew while not being an antagonist (i.e. self-antagging).
    - Do not make yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for one specific crew member in a way that would actively detract from the other player's enjoyment of the shift.
    - Do not, as a crewmate, hide the nuclear fission explosive (i.e. "the nuke") in an impossible to see location.
    - Significant End-of-round grief (EORG) is not allowed. This includes attacking, destroying, polluting, and injuring without reason both *at* and *on the way to* Central Command.[/color]
        * This also extends to the following:
            * Neutral parties, such as space dragons or sentient artifacts activating harmful nodes.
            * Attempts to block the docking ports or ports leading into Central Command.
            * Explosives and strategies with capacity for high collateral damage should not be used on or around the evacuation shuttle after it arrives at the station.
    [color=#ffffff]- Department strikes (ex: cargonia and any variation thereof), riots, cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are strictly forbidden. These activities are generally antagonist-only and all players regardless of antagonist status must obtain admin Central Command permission before engaging in this behavior (you are extremely unlikely to get permission).
    - AFK (aka SSD) and catatonic players are considered to have the same rights as a conscious crewmate.[/color]

    [color=#00c5ff]2B. Ahelp Guidelines[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Do not ignore the admin help relay or abuse it by flooding it with garbage, checking for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"), using it as a chatroom, or sending messages of no substance. Hostility to administrators in the relay will result in your removal.
    - Intentionally disconnecting, responding with hostility, or refusing to respond when an admin privately messages you in-game will be met with an appeal-only ban.
    - All AHelp messages are relayed to the Grimbly Station Discord. If an admin is not online, aHelp it anyways!
    - If you are playing a departmental role and have to leave for more than 20 minutes, please head to cryo or notify an admin of your absence. This is to prevent role-hogging by AFK players. Failure to do so may result in admin cryo, whereas repeat offenders may receive rolebans or tempbans based on severity.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Follow Chat Guidelines[/color]
    
    [color=#00c5ff]3A. Use English and Be respectful[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Use English as your primary method of communication within the game and Grimbly Station servers.
    - Do not spam.
    - Do not advertise.
    - Be respectful towards other players in LOOC and OOC channels, and avoid making others uncomfortable. This can range anywhere from starting arguments to personal attacks against others, depending on the context.
    - We have a zero tolerance policy for hate speech, discrimination, threats, harassment, and other forms of hateful/harmful behavior. Failure to comply with this rule will result in community removal.
    - No racist remarks towards in-game races/morphotypes/borgs (i.e. Simulated Racism), while you don’t have to like everybody, you should not be acting upon nor expressing your distaste for other races/morphotypes/borgs. Failure to comply will result in an appeal-only ban.
    - Do not excessively complain in Dead, LOOC, or OOC channels. This further extends to complaining about the current or prior round in the Grimbly Station discord. If you have an issue aHelp it or go to the help channel in the discord. Excessive complaining (also known as being an OOC baby) does not add to the experience for anyone and makes you liable to administrative action.[/color]

    [color=#00c5ff]3B. Avoid FailRP Communication[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Do not use netspeak in character (i.e. btw, lmfao).
    - Do not use the Emotes channel to bypass an inability to speak. This includes examples like "motions for you to put parmesan THEN sauce on the spaghetti," "im friendly," and "huh weird looks like I can't type."
    - Use the LOOC and OOC channels properly. Don’t speak of in-character matters in those channels unless you’re asking questions related to in-game concepts.[/color]
       * DO NOT use in-character channels to bypass a lack of ability to use OOC/LOOC chats (e.g. "Huh, wonder where captain went? *OOC* He probably left to get dinner lol"). This will result in an immediate dewhitelist.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Follow Metagaming guidelines[/color]

    [color=#00c5ff]4A. Death Rules and New Life Rules[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- If you die and get revived, do not act on things you saw while you were dead.
    - If a player dies and is brought back by way of cloning or borgification, they forget the last five minutes leading up to their death and cannot describe who or what killed them.
    - Players that are revived by using a defibrillator can only recall vague details about their death, such as "Someone shot me" or "I was set ablaze" but they cannot recall details beyond that.[/color]

    [color=#00c5ff]4B. Meta Behaviors[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Do not engage in meta-communications. This includes using chat channels outside of what is available in-game to communicate with other players in the same game.
    - Players are allowed to have in-character relationships (friends, enemies, or otherwise), however they cannot be used as a reason to grant or deny things based exclusively on having a relationship with one another(i.e. Meta-Friending).
    - You are allowed to have knowledge of past experiences with someone else in prior shifts. This does not give you permission to hold a grudge against someone that results in you treating them differently in an unfair way (i.e. Meta-Grudging).
    - Antagonists in previous rounds must not be treated differently due to their prior antagonist status. Notwithstanding, confession of crimes committed in a prior shift are still admissible in court.
    - Do not "Antag Roll." This is the act of joining rounds for the purpose of seeing if you joined as an antagonist, and leaving soon after if not. Players who have a history of this behavior will have their whitelist revoked and/or face a ban.
    - Do not place players into cryosleep unless they have given consent to do so, they are fully catatonic, or they have been sentenced to preservative stasis. Always examine a character to double check if they are SSD or catatonic prior to placing them into cryosleep.[/color]
    [color=#ff0000]- Do not stream the current round to the Grimbly Station Discord.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]Please report players who violate this rule.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] [color=#fcff00]All constructed/summoned beings that have laws are bound by those laws and must abide by them.[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- If a being has a master, they MUST follow their master's orders.
    - Your master is held accountable if they order you to do something malicious.[/color]
        * This does not apply to breaking server rules. If you are ordered to do something that would break a server rule, disregard it and inform an admin.
    [color=#ffffff]- Not having orders, or being given free will by your master does NOT give you permission to self-antag or grief the crew.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Follow Naming Conventions[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- In-character names must fit the server standards of:[/color]
        * Doesn't make obvious references
        * Doesn't disturb roleplay
        * Isn't obscene
      [color=#ffffff]OR[/color]
        * Is a result of random name generation.
    [color=#ffffff]- The only exception to the above is that theatrical roles like clown, boxer, and mime are allowed stage names with some freedom, as long as it is not obscene.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Follow Roleplay Guidelines[/color]
    
    [color=#00c5ff]8A. Character RP Guidelines[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Treat your character as a separate entity from you, the player. Your character's actions, feelings, and knowledge in-game should be based solely on the character's experiences and not your own as the player. Low roleplay actions that have no regard for your character or the setting (Memes, silly copy paste spam IC) are not acceptable.
    - Low roleplay actions that have no regard for your character or little bearing on setting (such as memes, silly copy paste spam IC) are not acceptable. Your character is a worker aboard a space station and will be held accountable.
    - Character development can occur over rounds but each round is a soft-reset, meaning you can have previous shift experience but your character will never have died in the past.
    - Non-security personnel should not seek to kill or detain unrelated threats (i.e validhunting). Crew may neutralize threats when they present themselves or if they are relevant to the crew member in question.[/color]
        * Certain severe emergencies may make it reasonable for normal crew to defend themselves and their station, such as nuclear operatives, a zombie outbreak, space dragon attack, or other critical situation.

    [color=#00c5ff]8B. Role Standard Guidelines[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Command and Security will be held to a higher standard for roleplay. Failure to comply will result in rolebans.
    - By picking prisoner, you have chosen to RP as a prisoner.[/color]
        * You are still subject to the same rules regarding escalation. You should only seek to escape from the brig with good reasoning (e.g. abusive security personnel, badly damaged permanent brig, lack of parole consideration DESPITE good behavior, etc.) OR after a 30 minute grace period.
        * Escaping for no reason OR before the 30 minute grace period is considered a self-antagonistic activity.
        * If you are unsure whether your escape reason is valid, feel free to AHelp it first. [color=#ff0000]Lack of administrator response does not constitute approval[/color].

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Follow Escalation Guidelines[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Do not escalate situations needlessly. Very few things are deserving of a fight to the death.[/color]
        * If a fight results in someone being critically injured, seek medical help for them. If they die, do not destroy or otherwise hide their body.
    [color=#ffffff]- Antagonistic ghost roles, and pest ghost roles like mice are always fair game for attacking. Don't grief crew-aligned ghost roles like familiars, borgs, drones, or pets without provocation.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Follow Antagonist Guidelines[/color]

    [color=#00c5ff]10A. Antagonist Behavioral Guidelines[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- The damage antagonists cause should be roughly proportional to their objectives, and contribute towards achieving them in some way.[/color]
        * Antagonists have leniency in regards to what they can and can’t do.  If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're about to do is allowed, feel free to ahelp and ask an admin. [color=#ff0000]Lack of administrator response does not constitute approval[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Antagonists exist not only as a role for your character but also as a game mechanic. Seek to push forward the round through your antagonistic actions, rather than grind it to halt in pursuit of your objectives.
    - Exploits, arrivals camping, unnecessary round extensions, and other extremely lame behavior are forbidden.[/color]

    [color=#00c5ff]10B. Antagonist Roleplay Guidelines[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Other antagonists are not necessarily your friends. Traitors, rat kings, and possibly even space dragons are free agents, but no one should be working together with xenomorphs or zombies.
    - Ghost roles have their own independent rules that must be followed.[/color] [color=#ff0000]Breaking these rules can result in a ban, whitelist removal, or both.[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- As a non-sentient or partially-sentient antagonist, you are expected to have only a limited understanding of space stations and their mechanics.[/color]
        * Slimes, zombies, spiders, etc. Should not be targeting the gravity generator or the AME, nor should they be unnecessarily spacing the station.
    [color=#ffffff]- Antagonist roles fall under 1 of 3 categories:[/color]
        * Sapient - Your character is humanoid. This applies to Space Ninjas, Nuclear Operatives, Syndicate Agents, etc. Space-Law & SoP gives you protections unless specifically stated otherwise.
        * Sentient - Your character is nonhumanoid. This applies to Space Dragons, Rat Kings, and other complex non-humanoid ghost-role antagonists. Space-Law & SoP gives you less protections unless specifically stated otherwise.
        * Nonsentient/Partially-sentient - As a non-sentient or partially-sentient antagonist, you are expected to have only a limited understanding of space stations and their mechanics. Slimes, zombies, spiders, etc. Should not be targeting the gravity generator or the AME, nor should they be unnecessarily spacing the station.

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Psionics[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Players that have psionic powers are allowed to use them at-will to accomplish their roleplay goals. It should be noted that in-character consequences can happen as a result of their use, including being stripped of psionic powers or even death.
    - As a mantis, it is not your goal to hunt down psionics. Do not mindbreak others against their will solely because they have psionic powers.[/color]
        * This is given more leniency on Code White or if someone is actively abusing their Psionics.
        * Be sure to work with Security accordingly to deal with this.

[color=#a4885c]12.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Follow Powergaming Guidelines[/color]

    [color=#00c5ff]12A. General Powergaming Guidelines[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Don't rush for or prepare equipment unrelated to your job for no purpose other than to have it "just in case" (referred to as "Powergaming").[/color]
        * Finding something laying around without a clear owner is a generally a valid reason, this mainly applies to maintenance items. 
        * If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're allowed to go for, feel free to ahelp and ask an admin. [color=#ff0000]Lack of administrator response does not constitute approval[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- A medical doctor does not need insulated gloves gamestart, and the Head of Personnel does not need to give themselves armory access so they can go grab a gun. Have an actual reason for needing these things.
    - Don't manufacture weapons, bombs, or deadly poisons before you know of any reason you would need them.
    - Don't preemptively hide antagonist objectives or preemptively secure them with higher security than normally required.[/color]

    [color=#00c5ff]12B. Role-Specific Powergaming Guidelines[/color]
    [color=#ffffff] Security of antagonist objective items:[/color]
        * Hiding antagonist objective items or preemptively securing them with higher security than usually required or than would make logical sense violates our powergaming and roleplay guidelines.
        * If you acquire an antagonist objective item in a non-Standard approved manner, you should try and return it to its rightful owner. If this is not possible you should try and secure it to the best of your abilities. You may coordinate with other crew to achieve this goal.
    [color=#ffffff]- Logistics Gameplay Guidelines:[/color]
        * Salvage should not hoard items and weapons unless there is a critical situation on the station that calls for it. Failure to comply with this will result in a roleban. See example considerations below.
            * Salvage shouldn't have a weaponpile comparable to the Station Armory, coordinate with Logistics to give these to Security.
            * Salvage shouldn't hoard materials and should put effort into moving materials back to Logistics.
            * Salvage shouldn't hoard items that other departments are in demand of (Chemvends, exotic seeds, etc.) without permission from that department.
            * If you are unsure what you are allows to keep and not allowed to keep, ask via aHelp.
        * Salvage is HIGHLY ENCOURAGED to use fulton beacons and fultons to transfer goods from the Reclaimer back to the station.
        * The Reclaimer is free to be edited as Salvage (with LO approval) wishes to see fit.
        * Some leeway to powergaming as Salvage is given if you are actively contributing to the station, so long as it does not violate the aforementioned Powergaming Guidelines.
        * As LO and Cargo Technicians, put some effort into ensuring items get to their respective entities. See example considerations below.
            * Notify over radio that a supply request for the respective department/individual arrived.
            * Deliver the supplies to the respective department/individual.
    [color=#ffffff]- Epistemics Gameplay Guidelines:[/color]
        * Don't ask borgs to rob all of Logistics' supplies, there are other departments that demand supplies as well. If you are a non-emagged borg and someone asks you to do this aHelp it.
        * Borging should always be saved in case someone's body is gibbed or unless they request otherwise with proper documentation.


[color=#ff0000]SECURITY & COMMAND RULES[/color]
[color=#fcff00]These rules apply to any individual who is promoted or is acting in the place of a Security/Command role (unless they are an antagonist).[/color]

[color=#a4885c]13.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Security and command roles are held to a higher standard and must follow space law.[/color]
    [color=#00c5ff]13A. Command & Security Standards[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Security, Justice, and Command roles are held to a higher standard of roleplay, and are expected to know and perform their jobs to the best of their ability. These roles often heavily impact the round and require more careful and conscientious roleplay; if you cannot meet these requirements do not take these roles.[/color]
        * These three departments are required to read and follow Grimbly Station Space Law, Standard Operating Procedure, Alert Procedure, and Company Policy to the best of their ability.
    [color=#ffffff]- Abandoning your role to go do whatever you want instead of managing your department or maintaining security, abusing your position or using it to make arbitrary or malicious choices to the detriment of the station, and being negligent to the point of harm is prohibited.
    - Be competent in your job and department. Failure to know the basics of your department is liable to result in a job ban.[/color]
        * A CMO should know basic chemistry and treatment.
        * An LO should know basic money management, shuttle piloting, mailing, and Salvage procedures.
        * An HoS should know Space Law, Brig timers, considerations of criminal cases, etc.
        * A Captain should know how to delegate jobs, the basics of each department, and how to handle internal conflicts.
        * An HoP should know how to do basic service roles, job assignment, and ID permission considerations on a case-by-case basis.
        * A MG should know how to do xenoarcheology, anomaly management, and psionic/glimmer management.
        * A CE should know how to repair, basic atmos distro setup, and setup power.
    [color=#ffffff]- As Command and Security are more RP intensive than other departments, communication is essential to these roles. Failure to communicate with others is liable to result in a job ban.
    - Uphold the Law & maintain order. Do not engage in lawbreaking activity or troublemaker behavior. Security is expected to intervene into criminal activity where possible. Heads of Staff are at minimum expected to report criminal activity to Security.
    - Command members besides the Logistics Officer are not permitted to leave the station on salvage expeditions.[/color]

    [color=#00c5ff]13B. Chronological Considerations[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- If you don’t have time to play a full round, do not select these roles.
    - If you need to leave your computer temporarily, send an ahelp or notify your fellow crew via the radio.
    - If you need to leave the round, notify your fellow crew via departmental radio, notify the admins via aHelp, and put your equipment in its respective secure containment prior to going to cryo.[/color]
        * If you need to leave IMMEDIATELY, please at least send an ahelp saying that you're leaving so we can notify your peers accordingly.

    [color=#00c5ff]13C. Roleplay-Gameplay Standards[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Security and Command roles are forbidden from using a syndicate uplink to receive contraband without written permission from Central Command.
    - Do not hire random crew to be your bodyguards or promote random crewmember to Captain or a Head of Staff at random. If you need bodyguards, talk to your security department. If you need a new Command role, talk to the personnel in that related department.
    - Do not abandon the station during Nuclear Operatives. You are supposed to protect the station, not let operatives kill everyone on it without a fight.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]14.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Security (and Command where applicable) should try to remain non-lethal and effect arrests. Security/Command will be expected to answer for use of lethal force. Security/Command will be expected to effect arrests on criminals and prevent them from dying while in custody, even if lethal force is used. [/color]

[color=#00c5ff]In the following special circumstances, lethal force may be used by Security:[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Lethal force is used against you (ex: firearms, lasers, disabling/stunning weapons with intent to kill, deadly melee weapons)
    - Suspect is equipped with dangerous equipment only used by enemy agents/antagonists and is not cuffed nor surrendering (ex: Bloodred Hardsuit, China Lake, C-20R, etc.).
    - You determine that your life or the life of another person is in immediate danger.
    - The suspect is unable to be safely detained by less-lethal means. This includes suspects who continually resist efforts to be cuffed or continuously manage to escape.
    - If no other reasonable options are readily available and allowing the suspect to continue would be an unreasonable danger to the station/crew.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]15.[/color] [color=#fcff00]Security/Command are expected to protect detainees in their custody to the best of their ability so as long as it does not come to unreasonable risk to themselves, the crew, or the station at large to do so.[/color]
    [color=#ffffff]- Brig times should generally not exceed 20 minutes unless the crime is permabriggable.
    - Security may choose to confiscate dangerous items (weapons, firearms) as well as items used to commit crimes or items that prove problematic in possession of the detainee (tools, insulated gloves, etc.).
    - Security may inspect PDAs of detainees and withhold them for the duration of detention, but can only confiscate them if they are obviously contraband. Suspicion alone is NOT sufficient for PDA confiscation by Security.
    - Security is prohibited from checking crewmates for implants without reasonable suspicion.
    - Detainees that die in your custody must be cloned unless they have been (legally) executed or have committed suicide.
    - Executions must be for a capital crime, used only as a last resort, and MUST be authorized by the highest ranking member of Security, who will answer to the use of execution.[/color]
    - Detainees in the brig have the right to know what they are being charged with.
