  # Rule 6: Naming Conventions
    - In-character names must fit the server standards of:
      - [color=#ffe59d]* Doesn't make obvious references[/color]
      - [color=#ffe59d]* Doesn't disturb roleplay[/color]
      - [color=#ffe59d]* Isn't obscene[/color]
      - OR
      - [color=#ffe59d]* Is a result of random name generation.[/color]
    - The only exception to the above is that theatrical roles like clown, boxer, and mime are allowed stage names with some freedom, as long as it is not obscene.
