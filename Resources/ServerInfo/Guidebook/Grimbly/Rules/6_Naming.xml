  <font color="#fcff00"># Rule 6: Follow Naming Conventions</color>
    - In-character names must fit the server standards of:
      <font color="#ffe59d">* Doesn't make obvious references
      * Doesn't disturb roleplay
      * Isn't obscene</font>
      OR
      <font color="#ffe59d">* Is a result of random name generation.</font>
    - The only exception to the above is that theatrical roles like clown, boxer, and mime are allowed stage names with some freedom, as long as it is not obscene.
