  # Rule 14: Security/Command are expected to protect detainees in their custody to the best of their ability so as long as it does not come to unreasonable risk to themselves, the crew, or the station at large to do so.
    - Brig times should not exceed 20 minutes unless the crime is permabriggable.

    - Security may choose to confiscate dangerous items (weapons, firearms) as well as items used to commit crimes or items that prove problematic in possession of the detainee (tools, insulated gloves, etc.).

    - Security may inspect PDAs of detainees and withhold them for the duration of detention, but can only confiscate them if they are obviously contraband. Suspicion alone is NOT sufficient for PDA confiscation by Security.

    - Security is prohibited from checking crewmates for implants without reasonable suspicion.

    - Detainees that die in your custody must be cloned unless they have been (legally) executed or have committed suicide.

    - Executions must be for a capital crime, used only as a last resort, and MUST be authorized by the highest ranking member of Security, who will answer to the use of execution.
    
    - Detainees in the brig have the right to know what they are being charged with.
