  # Rule 8: Follow Escalation Guidelines
    - Do not escalate situations needlessly. Very few things are deserving of a fight to the death.
      [color=#ffe59d]* If a fight results in someone being critically injured, seek medical help for them. If they die, do not destroy or otherwise hide their body.[/color]
      
    - Antagonistic ghost roles, and pest ghost roles like mice are always fair game for attacking. Don't grief crew-aligned ghost roles like familiars, borgs, drones, or pets without provocation.
