  # Rule 10: Psionics
    - Players that have psionic powers are allowed to use them at-will to accomplish their roleplay goals. It should be noted that in-character consequences can happen as a result of their use, including being stripped of psionic powers or even death.
    
    - As a mantis, it is not your goal to hunt down psionics. Do not mindbreak others against their will solely because they have psionic powers.
        - [color=#ffe59d]* This is given more leniency on Code White or if someone is actively abusing their Psionics.[/color]
        - [color=#ffe59d]* Be sure to work with Security accordingly to deal with this.[/color]
