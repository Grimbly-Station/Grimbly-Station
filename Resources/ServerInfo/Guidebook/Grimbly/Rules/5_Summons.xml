  # Rule 5: All constructed/summoned beings that have laws are bound by those laws and must abide by them.
    - If a being has a master, they MUST follow their master's orders.

    - Your master is held accountable if they order you to do something malicious.
      [color=#ffe59d]* This does not apply to breaking server rules. If you are ordered to do something that would break a server rule, disregard it and inform an admin.[/color]
      
    - Not having orders, or being given free will by your master does NOT give you permission to self-antag or grief the crew.
