  # Rule 9: Antagonist Guidelines
  ## 9A. Behavioral Guidelines
    - The damage antagonists cause should be roughly proportional to their objectives, and contribute towards achieving them in some way.
      - [color=#ffe59d]* Antagonists have leniency in regards to what they can and canâ€™t do.  If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're about to do is allowed, feel free to ahelp and ask an admin.[/color]
      - [color=#ff0000]Lack of administrator response does not constitute approval[/color]

    - Antagonists exist not only as a role for your character but also as a game mechanic. Seek to push forward the round through your antagonistic actions, rather than grind it to halt in pursuit of your objectives.

    - Exploits, arrivals camping, unnecessary round extensions, and other extremely lame behavior are forbidden.

  ## 9B. Antagonist Roleplay Guidelines
    - Other antagonists are not necessarily your friends. Traitors, rat kings, and possibly even space dragons are free agents, but no one should be working together with xenomorphs or zombies.

    - Ghost roles have their own independent rules that must be followed. 
    [color=#ff0000]Breaking these rules can result in a ban, whitelist removal, or both.[/color]

    - As a non-sentient or partially-sentient antagonist, you are expected to have only a limited understanding of space stations and their mechanics.
      - [color=#ffe59d]* Slimes, zombies, spiders, etc. Should not be targeting the gravity generator or the AME, nor should they be unnecessarily spacing the station.[/color]
    
    - Antagonist roles fall under 1 of 3 categories:
      - [color=#ffe59d]* Sapient - Your character is humanoid. This applies to Space Ninjas, Nuclear Operatives, Syndicate Agents, etc. Space-Law and SoP gives you protections unless specifically stated otherwise.[/color]
      - [color=#ffe59d]* Sentient - Your character is nonhumanoid. This applies to Space Dragons, Rat Kings, and other complex non-humanoid ghost-role antagonists. Space-Law and SoP gives you less protections unless specifically stated otherwise.[/color]
      - [color=#ffe59d]* Nonsentient/Partially-sentient - As a non-sentient or partially-sentient antagonist, you are expected to have only a limited understanding of space stations and their mechanics. Slimes, zombies, spiders, etc. Should not be targeting the gravity generator or the AME, nor should they be unnecessarily spacing the station. [/color]
