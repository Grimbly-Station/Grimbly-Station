  # Rule 13: Security Escalation
    - Security (and Command where applicable) should try to remain non-lethal and effect arrests. 

    - Security/Command will be expected to answer for use of lethal force. 
    
    - Security/Command will be expected to effect arrests on criminals and prevent them from dying while in custody, even if lethal force is used.

  [color=#a4885c]In the following special circumstances, lethal force may be used by Security:[/color]
    - Lethal force is used against you (ex: firearms, lasers, disabling/stunning weapons with intent to kill, deadly melee weapons)

    - Suspect is equipped with dangerous equipment only used by enemy agents/antagonists and is not cuffed nor surrendering (ex: Bloodred Hardsuit, China Lake, C-20R, etc.).

    - You determine that your life or the life of another person is in immediate danger.

    - The suspect is unable to be safely detained by less-lethal means. This includes suspects who continually resist efforts to be cuffed or continuously manage to escape.
    
    - If no other reasonable options are readily available and allowing the suspect to continue would be an unreasonable danger to the station/crew.
